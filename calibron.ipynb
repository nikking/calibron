    "# Solving Calibron Puzzle in Python\n",

    "_Spoiler Alert:_ This Notebook does contain the puzzle solution below.\n",

    "The Calibron 12-Block Puzzle is a devilishly simple puzzle invented by Theodore Edison. For a detailed history, check out http://www.pavelspuzzles.com/2010/08/the_calibron_12block_puzzle.html. \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the puzzle, you must arrange the 12 pieces into a perfect rectangle. This is easier said than done as there are ~1.96 trillion possible piece permutations \n",

    "## General approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like sudoku solving, there are probably many shortcuts that can be created to solve this puzzle. My goal was to see if I could write a mostly brute force algorithm that ran in a reasonable ammount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Assumptions: Although there are other possible rectangular dimensions that have the correct area, this solution assumes a 56 x 56 square.\n",
    "1. Create a board represented by a 56 x 56 Boolean coordinate system. All coordinates are False until occupied by a piece.\n",
    "2. Intitialize the starting position of (0, 0), where the next piece will be placed. The position will always be the smallest x, y coordinate pair that is False.\n",
    "3. Calculate the largest possible piece that could be place at the current position. Also calculate the smallest side for any remaining pieces.\n",
    "4. Iterate though all pieces, checking if they are valid. \n",
    "5. If a piece can be placed, update the board, position, largest pieces, and smallest side. The new position is determine by finding the smallest (x, y) coordinate (smallest x then smallest y). Then repeat steps 2-4.\n",
    "6. If a the board is no pieces can be placed in the current position, remove the last piece placed.\n",
    "7. Return a solution once all pieces have been placed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance was greatly improved by using numpy arrays and numba just-in-time compilation. I also used %prun to profile the various methods and trim down execution time. A valid solution an be found in a matter of seconds and all solutions could be found in under two minutes on my 5 year old laptop (i7-4650U CPU @ 1.70GHz).\n",
    "\n",
    "Space complexity should be O(n^2) where n is the number of pieces. All pieces swapping is done in-place and a copy of the piece list is created every time a new pieces is placed. To estimate the time complexity I think I'd have to run some different profiling with different sets of pieces."
